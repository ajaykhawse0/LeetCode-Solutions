**Difficulty:** Medium | **Accuracy:** 47.82% | **Submissions:** 200K+ | **Points:** 4 | **Average Time:** 25m

## Problem Statement
Given a weighted, undirected, and connected graph with `V` vertices and `E` edges, your task is to find the sum of the weights of the edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph. The graph is provided as a list of edges, where each edge is represented as `[u, v, w]`, indicating an edge between vertex `u` and vertex `v` with edge weight `w`.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `V = 3`, `E = 3`, `Edges = [[0, 1, 5], [1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 1]]`

**Output:** `4`

**Explanation:**
The Spanning Tree resulting in a weight of 4 is shown above. *(Edges taken: [0, 2, 1] and [1, 2, 3]. Sum = 1 + 3 = 4.)*

### Example 2
**Input:** `V = 2`, `E = 1`, `Edges = [[0, 1, 5]]`

**Output:** `5`

**Explanation:** Only one Spanning Tree is possible which has a weight of 5.

## Constraints
* `2 ≤ V ≤ 1000`
* `V-1 ≤ E ≤ (V*(V-1))/2`
* `1 ≤ w ≤ 1000`
* The graph is connected and doesn't contain self-loops & multiple edges.
